# Decode @ UWM: A Crash Course in Node.js!
Welcome!  If you're reading this you are probably a member of Decode @ UWM.  Today we are going to learn about a JavaScript framework that powers applications all over the world: [Node.js!](https://nodejs.org/en/) Then we will use our new knowledge to build a simple Discord chat bot. 

By the end of this guide you can expect to have learned the following:
- The basics of the client-server architecture 
- What Node.js is and how to install it on your machine
- How to use Node.js to set up a simple Discord chat bot. 

This presentation has been written in a guide format so that you can follow along at home, or try this at a later date.  Right now all of the terminal commands assumes you are using a bash-like terminal (linux, MacOS).  I will try to add in Windows commands at a later date.  This is also written assumming you have no prior knowledge of Node.js.  If you feel that it is missing crucial information or something is confusing open an issue on the repo and we can get it fixed!
